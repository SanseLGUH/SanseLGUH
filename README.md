# ⚡ SanseLGUH — Hardcore Rust Developer

![Codewars](https://github.r2v.ch/codewars?user=SanseLGUH)

## 🧠 Who Am I?

I’m a systems-level Rust developer building fast, fearless, and future-proof software.
No fluff. No frameworks for the sake of trends. Just raw speed, safety, and control.
I write code that hits **hard** and **runs lean** — from **network stacks** to **GUI engines**, from **low-level Windows internals** to **cross-platform apps**. I aim to become a **10x developer** by doing the work others won’t touch.

## 🔧 Stack

### 💥 Core Rust Power
- `reqwest`, `tungstenite`, `actix` — HTTP, WebSockets, async servers at warp speed.
- `sqlx` (Postgres, SQLite), `rocksdb`, `surrealdb` — storage, optimized for real-world loads.

### 🖥 GUI & App Engines
- `tauri`, `druid`, `slint`, `egui` — Native UI across platforms, no Electron bloat.
  
### ⚙️ Systems Work
- **Windows APIs**: GDI, GDI+, OpenGL, Direct3D 11/12
- **Interfacing**: JNI, Mono embedding
- **Reverse Engineering / Hooking**: Detours, inline patching

## 🧬 Goals
- ✅ Become a **10x Rust developer** — deeply technical, toolmaker, unstoppable.
