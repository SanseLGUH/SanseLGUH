# Stack

Core Rust Technologies
reqwest, tungstenite, actix — for HTTP clients, WebSocket handling, and high-performance async servers.
sqlx (Postgres, SQLite), rocksdb, surrealdb — for robust and scalable storage solutions, optimized for real-world workloads.

GUI and Application Engines
tauri, druid, slint, egui/eframe — for building native cross-platform interfaces without the overhead of Electron.

Systems Programming and Interfacing
Windows APIs: GDI, GDI+, OpenGL, Direct3D 11/12.
Interoperability: JNI integration, Mono embedding.

Reverse engineering and runtime modification: Detours, inline patching, low-level hooks.
